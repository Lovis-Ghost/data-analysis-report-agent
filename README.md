# Data Analysis Report Agent

A Streamlit-based data analysis assistant that automatically analyzes uploaded CSV datasets,
detects data quality issues, generates visualizations, suggests suitable machine learning
tasks, and creates a downloadable Markdown report.

## Live Demo

[Open the Streamlit App](https://data-analysis-report-agent.streamlit.app)

## Project Overview

Data Analysis Report Agent is designed to help users quickly understand a dataset without
manually writing repeated exploratory data analysis code.

Users can upload a CSV file, and the application will automatically generate dataset
summaries, missing value checks, duplicate row checks, descriptive statistics,
visualizations, and machine learning task suggestions.

This project demonstrates practical skills in Python, data analysis automation, Streamlit
web development, and basic AI-agent-style workflow design.

## Features

* Upload CSV files through a web interface
* Preview dataset records
* Display dataset shape and column information
* Check missing values and duplicate rows
* Calculate a data quality score
* Give automatic data cleaning suggestions
* Automatically detect numerical, categorical, and ID-like columns
* Exclude ID-like columns from unsuitable visualizations
* Treat binary numerical columns as categorical features
* Generate numerical column visualizations
* Generate categorical column visualizations
* Show correlation analysis for suitable numerical columns
* Suggest suitable machine learning task types:

  * Regression
  * Binary classification
  * Multi-class classification
* Recommend suitable machine learning models and evaluation metrics
* Generate and download an improved Markdown data analysis report

## How to Run the Project

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lovis-Ghost/data-analysis-report-agent.git
cd data-analysis-report-agent
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the Streamlit app

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Example Use Case

For a customer churn dataset, the agent can automatically detect that the target column
`Churn` is suitable for a binary classification task.

It then suggests possible models such as:

* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest
* XGBoost Classifier

It also recommends suitable evaluation metrics such as:

* Accuracy
* Precision
* Recall
* F1-score
* ROC-AUC

## Current Version

### V1.3 - Smart Insights and Enhanced Report

The current version supports automatic dataset analysis, smart column detection, data
quality assessment, correlation analysis, machine learning task suggestion, and an
improved Markdown report.

## Future Improvements

* Add model training for baseline classification and regression models
* Add PDF or Word report export
* Add LLM-generated natural language insights
* Add an agent workflow page to explain the reasoning process
